# iOSx ShellCore 1.0

iOSx ShellCore is a lightweight shell for iOSx, allowing you to interact with it's filesystem and execute basic shell commands. You can manage users, navigate directories, view system information, and more.



## Getting Started

### 1. Run the Filesystem Creation Command (`cfs`)

Before you can use any commands or interact with the shell, you must first create the filesystem. To do this, you need to run the `cfs` command. This will set up the basic structure for the FS.
Then you should be set!
